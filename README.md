# Pivot-Table
## Background
Using pivot tables to display table information about car inventory to simplify analysis and make data faster to analyze
## Sheet 1: Car Inventory
This sheet contains the table used to create the Pivot tables in the later sheets. Tihs table displays the make and model of cars in inventory. Along with that it also contains the color and mileage of each vehicle. It also displays the price point that each vehicle is intended to sell for along with how much each vehicle cost to purchase.
## Sheet 2: Count by Make and Model
This sheet contains the first Pivot table. This pivot table is organized with the columns displaying the colors of each vehicle while the rows shows the Make of vehicles along with the models and how much of each are in inventory. It features a drop down tab for the rows to isolate inventory depending on which make or model the user chooses to access.
## Sheet 3: Profit Margin by Makes
This sheet shows the Profit Margin of each makes of vehicle. The profit margin is found by subtracting the cost of the vehicles from the price the vehicles will be sold for. A calculated field was inserted to easily display this information and by inserting a formula to subtract the cost of the vehicles from the price the vehicles will be sold so when viewing the pivot table one can see the profit margin by makes and which make will yield the most profit and which will yield the least.
## Sheet 4: Average Cost of Makes
This sheet shows the average cost each make of vehicles cost to be purchased.
## sheet 5: Percentage by Color
This sheet is organized into a pivot table to show the percent of each color of vehicle that is in inventory for each make. It also contains a bar graph to visually show the percentage of each color of vehicle that is in inventory for each make.
